## Description:
In 2018 AD there were 134,561 people died of suicides. It is a very concerning to the Govenment as well as common citizens. So I have tried here to visualize the factors related to commit suicides in India. The datasets are collected from data.gov.in portal and wikipedia.com.


It's important to note that in India, suicide deaths are reported to concenrned authority, who investigate and compile a First Information Report (FIR) accordingly. The report includes the apparent cause of death on evidence collection and autopsy reports. The NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) maintains the record. So these data are dependent on community reports.
